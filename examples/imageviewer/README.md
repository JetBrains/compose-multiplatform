- Add to `local.properties` file located in the root directory (create if it doesn't exist):
  - `MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY` where `YOUR_KEY` is your key from previous step;
  - `sdk.dir=YOUR_SDK_PATH` where `YOUR_SDK_PATH` is a path to Android SDK in your system.
- Open project in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio and run `androidApp` configuration.
