/**
 * A Material Design [dropdown menu](https://material.io/components/menus#dropdown-menu).
 *
 * A [DropdownMenu] behaves similarly to a [Popup], and will use the position of the parent layout
 * to position itself on screen. Commonly a [DropdownMenu] will be placed in a [Box] with a sibling
 * that will be used as the 'anchor'. Note that a [DropdownMenu] by itself will not take up any
 * space in a layout, as the menu is displayed in a separate window, on top of other content.
 *
 * The [content] of a [DropdownMenu] will typically be [DropdownMenuItem]s, as well as custom
 * content. Using [DropdownMenuItem]s will result in a menu that matches the Material
 * specification for menus.
 *
 * [onDismissRequest] will be called when the menu should close - for example when there is a
 * tap outside the menu, or when the back key is pressed.
 *
 * [DropdownMenu] changes its positioning depending on the available space, always trying to be
 * fully visible. It will try to expand horizontally, depending on layout direction, to the end of
 * its parent, then to the start of its parent, and then screen end-aligned. Vertically, it will
 * try to expand to the bottom of its parent, then from the top of its parent, and then screen
 * top-aligned. An [offset] can be provided to adjust the positioning of the menu for cases when
 * the layout bounds of its parent do not coincide with its visual bounds. Note the offset will
 * be applied in the direction in which the menu will decide to expand.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material.samples.MenuSample
 *
 * @param expanded Whether the menu is currently open and visible to the user
 * @param onDismissRequest Called when the user requests to dismiss the menu, such as by
 * tapping outside the menu's bounds
 * @param offset [DpOffset] to be added to the position of the menu
