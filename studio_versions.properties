# Version properties for Android Studio which should correspond to the version of AGP
#
# Once you have a chosen version of AGP to upgrade to, go to
# https://developer.android.com/studio/archive and find the matching version of Studio.
# For example, if you are upgrading to AGP 3.6 alpha 05, look for the Studio 3.6 canary 5 build.
# (alpha maps to canary, beta to beta, rc to rc, and no suffix for stable in both cases)
#
# The download url should contain: ...ide-zips/3.6.0.5/android-studio-ide-191.5721125-linux...
# From this, the first number (3.6.0.5) is [studio_version], the first number in the filename (192)
# is the [idea_major_version] and the last number (5721125) is the [studio_build_number].
