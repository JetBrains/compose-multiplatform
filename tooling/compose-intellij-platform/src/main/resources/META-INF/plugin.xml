        The plugin provides a shared base for developing IntelliJ plugins with the
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/">Compose</a> UI framework.

        The plugin is in the early stages of development. Please use with caution!

        For now, it only provides Compose classes and native libraries for use at runtime,
        so that multiple IntelliJ plugins can share Compose classes and Skia bindings.
