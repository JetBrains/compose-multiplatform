        Thank you for taking the time to file a bug report.
        The Compose Multiplatform project works with issues in YouTrack, so please report issues over there:
        https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=CMP

        We had to create this issue template as a workaround for this GitHub bug:
        https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/153714
  - type: checkboxes
    attributes:
      label: Please confirm that you understood the above message
      options:
        - label: "I have read the message and will create the issue in YouTrack instead"
          required: true
