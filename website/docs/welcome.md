**Compose Multiplatform** is a declarative framework for sharing UIs across multiple platforms with Kotlin. 
It is based on [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and open-source contributors.

You can choose the platforms across which to share your UIs using Compose Multiplatform:

* [iOS](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-ios-android-template/#readme) (Alpha)
* [Android](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (via Jetpack Compose)
* [Desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-desktop-template/#readme) (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
* [Web](https://kotl.in/wasm-compose-example) (Experimental)

For example, you can share UIs between iOS and Android or Windows and MacOS.
