## General

Google's [Foundation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation#core) and [Design](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation#design) tutorials were originally written for Android but can be used as a reference for other targets.

## Libraries

### HTML
The Compose HTML library allows you to build reactive user interfaces for the web in Kotlin using the concepts and APIs of Compose to express the state, behavior, and logic of your application.

The HTML library provides multiple ways of declaring user interfaces in Kotlin with an ability to fully control your website layout with a declarative HTML/CSS API.

> Note that this library doesn't support Kotlin/Wasm yet.
